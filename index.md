## Background

I'm a Machine Learning Engineer at Bridgewater (AIA Labs) working on trustworthy LLM systems—evaluation pipelines with strict time-windowing, dispersion/consistency signals, probability calibration, and scalable FastAPI/Kubernetes services. I use structured and unstructured data with LLMs to pursue macroeconomic alpha.

Previously, I was a Quant Researcher (part-time) at Two Sigma, developing factor-neutral cross-sectional alphas, designing feature/learner-level decorrelation, and running leakage-safe walk-forward tests (OOS rank IC/IR). I earned an M.Eng. and B.S. at MIT; at the Julia Lab my thesis on physics-informed neural ODEs reduced strapdown INS error by ~63% vs a tuned EKF (GPS-denied), with a reproducible sim/eval harness. I also built a graph-based cyber-defense simulator (LLM-assisted agents), explored neuro-symbolic ideas, and studied low-complexity interpolation and mechanistic interpretability.

## Research Interests

1. Mechanistic Interpretability – Understanding and explaining the internal representations and computations of neural networks.
2. RL for LLMs – Policy-gradient methods that keep probability estimates stable as conditions shift.
3. Scientific Machine Learning – Physics-informed nets and differentiable simulators for data-sparse domains.

Off the keyboard I'm passionate about working out, love playing basketball, and enjoy keeping up with the latest AI/ML research.
