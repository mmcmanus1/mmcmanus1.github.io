## About

I'm an Engineer at **Bridgewater Associates** (AIA Labs) working on using LLMs to generate macroeconomic alpha.

Previously, I was a Quantitative Researcher (part-time) at **Two Sigma**, developing factor-neutral cross-sectional alphas, designing feature/learner-level decorrelation, and running leakage-safe walk-forward tests (OOS rank IC/IR).

I earned my M.Eng. and B.S. in Computer Science at **MIT** (GPA: 5.0/5.0). At the Julia Lab, my thesis on physics-informed neural ODEs reduced strapdown INS error by ~63% vs a tuned EKF in GPS-denied environments, with a reproducible sim/eval harness. I also built a graph-based cyber-defense simulator (LLM-assisted agents), explored neuro-symbolic ideas, and studied low-complexity interpolation and mechanistic interpretability.
