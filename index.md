I am interested in developing Machine Intelligence and Artificial General Intelligence. A few of my prior projects include: Neuro-symbolic learning for cybersecurity, physics-informed neural ODEs for inertial navigation, mechanistic interpretability of transformers and low complexity interpolation for deep neural networks.

## About

I'm a ML Engineer at **Bridgewater Associates** (AIA Labs) working on using LLMs to generate macroeconomic alpha.

Previously, I was a Quantitative Researcher at **Two Sigma**, developing factor-neutral cross-sectional alphas, designing feature/learner-level decorrelation, and running leakage-safe walk-forward tests (OOS rank IC/IR).

Before that I earned my M.Eng. and B.S. in Computer Science at **MIT** (GPA: 5.0/5.0). Where I wroked with Alan Edelman at the Julia Lab and Una May O'Reilly at the ALFA lab.
