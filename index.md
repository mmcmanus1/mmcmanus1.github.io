I'm an ML Engineer on Bridgewater Associates' AI & ML Team (AIA Labs)—the internal research group that couples proprietary tabular-data models, reasoning engines, and large-language-model (LLM) systems to generate macro-investing alpha.

## Background

* MIT — M.Eng. & B.S. in Computer Science (GPA 5.0/5.0).
  At the Julia Lab I developed a physics-informed neural-ODE framework that cut inertial-navigation drift by more than 60 percent in GPS-denied settings.([dspace.mit.edu][1])

* Two Sigma — Quantitative Research (part-time).
  Ran fast-cycle experiments on factor discovery and regime detection across multi-asset datasets, sharpening my data-driven market intuition.

* MIT Pokerbots — President.
  Led a month-long autonomous-poker competition for 250 + students, which sparked my long-standing fascination with reinforcement learning.

## Research Interests

1. LLM-Driven Macro Forecasting – Retrieval, chain-of-thought reasoning, and calibrated ensemble aggregation.
2. RL for LLMs – Policy-gradient methods that keep probability estimates stable as conditions shift.
3. Scientific Machine Learning – Physics-informed nets and differentiable simulators for data-sparse domains.

Off the keyboard I'm passionate about working out, love playing basketball, and enjoy keeping up with the latest AI/ML research.
