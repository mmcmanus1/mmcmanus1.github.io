I'm an Engineer on Bridgewater Associates' AI & ML Team (AIA Labs)—the internal research group that couples proprietary tabular-data models, reasoning engines, and large-language-model (LLM) systems to generate macro-investing alpha.

## Background

* MIT — M.Eng. & B.S. in Computer Science (GPA 5.0/5.0).
  At the Julia Lab I developed a physics-informed neural-ODE framework that cut inertial-navigation drift by more than 60 percent in GPS-denied settings.([dspace.mit.edu][1])

* Two Sigma — Quantitative Research (part-time).
  I developed cross-sectional signals on anonymized panels and built leakage-safe walk-forward pipelines with rolling normalization and liquidity-weighted scoring. Work emphasized factor-neutralization and decorrelation, targeting stable OOS rank IC/IR.

* MIT Pokerbots — President.
  Led a month-long autonomous-poker competition for 250 + students, which sparked my long-standing fascination with reinforcement learning.

## Research Interests

1. Mechanistic Interpretability – Understanding and explaining the internal representations and computations of neural networks.
2. RL for LLMs – Policy-gradient methods that keep probability estimates stable as conditions shift.
3. Scientific Machine Learning – Physics-informed nets and differentiable simulators for data-sparse domains.

Off the keyboard I'm passionate about working out, love playing basketball, and enjoy keeping up with the latest AI/ML research.
