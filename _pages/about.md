Welcome to my personal academic website. I'm Matt McManus, a researcher and recent graduate from MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL).

## Research Interests

My research focuses on the intersection of machine learning and practical applications, particularly in:

- **Scientific Machine Learning**: Developing physics-informed approaches to reduce drift in inertial navigation systems
- **Cybersecurity**: Evaluating large language models like GPT-3 in simulated cybersecurity scenarios, with emphasis on graph-based problems
- **Navigation Systems**: Working on improving the accuracy and reliability of autonomous navigation technologies

## Background

I recently completed my Master's thesis at MIT CSAIL, where I worked on "Inertial Navigation System Drift Reduction Using Scientific Machine Learning." This work explores how modern machine learning techniques can be applied to solve fundamental problems in navigation and autonomous systems.

## Current Work

I'm passionate about bridging the gap between theoretical machine learning advances and real-world applications, particularly in areas where reliability and precision are critical.
