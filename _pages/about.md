## About

I am working on the AI/ML team at Bridgewater Associates. My current work focuses on large-language-model agents and reinforcement-learning pipelines for Forecasting, a line of research I pursue in close collaboration with Daniel Kang (UIUC) and Bradly Stadie (Northwestern). 

Prior to joining Bridgewater full-time, I completed an M.Eng. and B.S. in Computer Science at MIT. At the Julia Lab, my master's thesis introduced a scientific-machine-learning framework that reduced inertial-navigation drift by more than 60 percent in GPS-denied settings. Earlier roles included a stint as a Quantitative Researcher at Two Sigma, where I applied statistical learning to multi-asset data and helped prototype factor-discovery tools.

My research interests span three themes:

1. AI for Macro & Markets – LLM-augmented research workflows, factor discovery, and interpretable risk models.
2. Scientific Machine Learning – Physics-informed neural nets and differentiable simulators for high-accuracy forecasting.
